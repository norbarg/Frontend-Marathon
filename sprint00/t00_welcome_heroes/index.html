        <p>
            A superhero is a person who does heroic deeds and has the ability to
            do them in a way that a normal person couldn’t. So in order to be a
            superhero,
            <strong
                >you need a power that is more exceptional than any power a
                normal human being could possess,</strong
            >
            and you need to use that power to accomplish good deeds. Otherwise,
            a policeman or a fireman could be considered a superhero. For
            instance, a good guy fighting a bad guy could be just a regular
            police story or detective story or human-interest story. But if it’s
            a good guy with a superpower who is fighting a bad guy, it becomes a
            superhero story. If the good guy is doing something that a normal
            human being couldn’t do, couldn’t accomplish, then I assume he
            becomes a superhero.

            One of the most iconic fictional characters in the world, Batman has
            dedicated his life to an endless crusade, a war on all criminals in
            the name of his murdered parents, who were taken from him when he
            was just a child. Since that tragic night, he has trained his body
            and mind to near physical perfection to be a self-made Super Hero.
